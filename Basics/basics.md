## ğŸš€When the range is from 10^-9 to 10^9 then we can use int say and when the range is from 10^-12 to 10^12 then we can use long and if the range is from 10^-18 to 10^18 then we can use lon long 

## ğŸš€Second step is learning about STL in C++ => Baiscally STL in C++ can be considered like the packages that we have used for the last many months, so basically their task is to reduce human effort and be more productive by providing templates mane ek kaam ko scratch se kyu hi karne ka when there are many stuffs available to help us that's the point

## ğŸš€So basically STL comprises of 4 things =>
ğŸš€containers
ğŸš€iterators
ğŸš€algorithms(matlab aaj agar mere ko ek sorting ka function likhna hai then I will not write it from scratch rahter will be writing that using the template provided by the STL)
ğŸš€functions or functors
